# _SaberMDAbir.github.io_

###### (Work in progress)

### Author
MD Abir A. Choudhury

### Purpose
A Personal Website

### URL
https://SaberMDAbir.github.io

### What is this for?
This website was designed and created to act as a start to my personal brand. With this project, I hope to delve myself deeper into the world of web apps, web programming, and Git.

### Why the github.io domain extension?
I really liked how Github provides access to use their own domain and it also is protected. This is one of the main reasons why I preferred using Github as a platform instead of using WordPress/PHP; also I didn't want to constantly have to make sure my website reflects the updates that WordPress constantly updates to.

### Built With
Bootstrap
(WIP)

### LICENSE
(WIP)

### Development Process
The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of this website.
